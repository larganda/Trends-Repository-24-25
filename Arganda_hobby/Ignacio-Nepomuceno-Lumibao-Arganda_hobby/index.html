                <strong>Reading</strong>
                <p>Reading have always been my thing, it was in senior high when I started hanging out at libraries a lot. Turns out, getting totally lost in a book there was the perfect way to quiet my social anxiety.</p>
                <strong>Book Collecting</strong>
                <p>My reading journey started with Wattpad when I was in grade 6, then a Kindle that I adored, but eye strain led me to physical copies. Buying a new book and placing it on the shelf is like adding a piece of happiness to my life. Below are my first treasures.</p>
                <strong>Baking</strong>
                <p>Baking was a hobby ever since. After graduating senior high, I took the leap and made it my own business. The best part? I'm earning money doing what I love.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies of Maria Curly Ann A. Lumibao</h2>
        <p>My hobbies revolve around a balance of nature, self-expression, and awareness.
            I love biking through scenic routes, just immersing myself in the peace nature brings.
            As an outdoor/adventurous wannabe, it gives me the opportunity to be one with nature.
            I've also recently become fond of jogging and working out. I like how it energizes me and keeps me grounded while helping me clear my mind.
            When I'm not outside and have time, I read educational and Christian books.
            I also enjoy painting, specifically the ready-made sketches that I've purchased.</p>

                <p>  Since childhood, MMA has been more than just a hobby it's my lifestyle. Growing up in a military 
                    family instilled discipline and a warrior’s mindset in me, which fueled my passion for martial arts. 
                    The styles I practice include Taekwondo, Kickboxing, Boxing, Muay Thai, and Wrestling. These disciplines 
                    have shaped me physically and mentally, making MMA not just a sport but a way of life. It’s my passion, my 
                    strength, and the heart of a warrior.</p>

                    I have a deep love for music and can play several instruments, including guitar, ukulele, 
                    piano, and drums. My passion for music also led me to learn singing, which serves as both
                     a form of self-expression and relaxation.

                    I enjoy capturing memories and meaningful moments through photography. Looking back at 
                    old photos is one of my favorite pastimes, allowing me to reflect on the past while shaping a better future.
